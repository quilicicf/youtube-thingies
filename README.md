Fumbling with youtube API.

## How to use

- Copy `youtube-thingies_example.json` to `~/.youtube-thingies.json`
- Put the API token in the COPIED file (you don't want to accidentally push it to github)
- Run `npm i -g` in the repository
- You can now run `yt-search` from anywhere on your machine :firework:
